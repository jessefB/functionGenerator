# Overview

This program is designed to save time by building C++ function definitions from their prototypes

I wrote this program as a refresher for C++, as I haven't used it for quite some time.

I like to code on paper first, lining out all the functions I will need. The logical next step would be to create all the prototypes I need. From there, it is just a lot of repetative work to copy and paste the prototypes and add brackets for definition. This program is designed to do the repetative work.

# Development Environment

I used Visual Studio Code with the C++ extension avaliable from Microsoft. MinGW G++ was the compiler. Only standard libraries were used, including `iostream` and `fstream`, and object types like `string` and `vector`.

# Future Work
* Make the classes more modular, especially the `Path` class. That could be really useful.
* Have a stronger and more robust command line interface
* Possibly modularize parts to work with other languages?
